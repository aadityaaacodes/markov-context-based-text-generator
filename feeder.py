# Under a sky streaked with shades of lavender and gold, a small fox darted through the tall grass, its ears twitching at every rustle. The wind carried the scent of pine and wildflowers, and somewhere in the distance, a creek bubbled over smooth stones. A worn leather satchel lay forgotten near an ancient oak, its contents spilling slightlyâ€”an old map, a compass, and a journal filled with sketches of strange symbols. The forest seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting for someone to notice the clues hidden in plain sight.
